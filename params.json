The software conforms with the [eStep standards](https://github.com/NLeSC/estep-checklist).\r\n\r\nThe original MATLAB implementation can be found at [this repository](https://github.com/NLeSC/SalientDetector-matlab)\r\n\r\nThe repository contains the following sub-folders:\r\n\r\n## Notebooks\r\nSeveral iPython notebooks testing and illustrating major functionality.\r\n\r\n## salientregions\r\nThe module for salient region detection functionality.\r\n\r\n## tests\r\nUnit tests for the code in salientregions.\r\n\r\n# Installation\r\n## Prerequisites\r\n* Python 2.7 or 3.5\r\n* pip\r\n* The python packages in `requirements.txt`.\r\n* OpenCV 3.1. There is two ways to install OpenCV:\r\n  * If you're using Conda, you can install OpenCV with the following command:\r\n\r\n  `conda install -c https://conda.anaconda.org/menpo opencv3`\r\n\r\n  * Otherwise, follow the instructions to [install OpenCV 3.1.0 manually](http://opencv-python-tutroals.readthedocs.org/en/latest/py_tutorials/py_setup/py_table_of_contents_setup/py_table_of_contents_setup.html#py-table-of-content-setup)\r\n\r\n\r\n## Installing the package\r\nTo install the package `salientregions`  in your environment:\r\n\r\n`pip install .`\r\n\r\nTo perform tests:\r\n\r\n`nosetests test`\r\n\r\n# Getting started\r\nThe source code documentation can be found [here](http://nlesc.github.io/SalientDetector-python/)\r\n\r\nThis code makes heavily use of the OpenCV library, so in order to understand how the code works, it helps to have a look at the [OpenCV Documentation](http://docs.opencv.org/3.1.0/).\r\n\r\n## Images\r\nIn OpenCV, images are represented as numpy arrays. Grayscale images are represented by a 2-dimensional array. Color images have a third dimension for the color channel. The Salient Region Detector has a few simplifying assumptions:\r\n* Color images have BGR channels\r\n* Images are assumed to be 8-bit. This is also the case for binary images, so they only have values of 0 and 255.\r\n\r\n## Detector object\r\nThe complete functionality of the salient region detectors are found in the Detector object. The SalientDetector implements DMSR detection, and MSSRDetector implements MSSR detection (see referred papers for more information about these algorithms).\r\nAn example of how to use the Detector can be found in [this iPython Notebook](https://github.com/NLeSC/SalientDetector-python/blob/master/Notebooks/DetectorExample.ipynb).\r\n\r\n# Contributing\r\nIf you want to contribute to the code, please have a look at the [eStep standarts](https://github.com/NLeSC/estep-checklist).\r\n\r\nWe use numpy-style code documentation.\r\n\r\n# References\r\nRanguelova, E.B. - Pauwels, E.J.\r\nMorphology-based Stable Salient Regions Detector\r\nProceedings of International Conference on Image and Vision Computing New Zealand 2006 , Great Barrier Island, New Zealand, p.97â€“102 \r\n",
